# rpg-cli (name yet to be decided)
rpg-cli (name yet to be decided) is a **CLI-based RPG game** based on the *Mega Man Battle Network Series*, where you control an Internet Navigator
(or in this case, a Console Navigator) through the use of your console to defeat viruses and (possibly) save the world via turn-based fighting.

This is a summer project initially made out boredom, so while there may some horrible code in some places, this is after all a learning experience
for me, so feedback is appreciated.

## Goals
- Have a fully fleshed out battle system akin to the turn actions of most RPGs whilst conbining
the ability to move similar to the MMBN or Starforce series
- The player's navi is handled in a file containing their navi's information, affected by what
happens in the game (Navi deletion is now real)
- Learn about the Console Line Interface by making my own CLI tool, and serve as an example to
others learning about making their own CLI

## How do I play?
rpg-cli (name yet to be decided) runs on Node.js, so you should install that first.
